# Understanding Low-Level Programming

Welcome to the **Understanding Low-Level Programming** repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring and mastering low-level programming concepts, such as memory management, pointers, system calls, and more. The content here is primarily written in C, with some assembly language for deeper insights into computer architecture and system operations.

## Introduction

Low-level programming is the foundation of computer science and software development. It provides an in-depth understanding of how software interacts with hardware and how to write efficient, resource-conscious programs. This repository is a collection of code examples, exercises, and notes intended to:

- Enhance your understanding of how computers work at a fundamental level.
- Teach essential skills like working with pointers, manipulating memory, and handling system calls.
- Bridge the gap between high-level programming and computer architecture.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To work with the code in this repository, you'll need the following:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- A basic understanding of programming in C
- Familiarity with command-line tools (e.g., `gcc`, `make`)
- (Optional) An assembler for assembly language code (e.g., NASM)

### Setting Up

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devalentineomonya/Understanding-Low-Level-programming.git
   cd Understanding-Low-Level-programming
   ```

2. Compile and run a sample program:

   ```bash
   gcc -o example examples/example.c
   ./example
   ```
